I setup this last year and haven't touched since then. A few months back, I've found out that you can register `.ninja` and `.rocks`. So I *had* to go and register `boats.ninja` and `boats.rocks`. I also registered `voges.photo` and `voges.photography`, but that's for another post.

Today, on my way back to London, I decided to finally use the new domains for something. That something is this blog (that was actually the plan when I registered them).
